                      Words often fail me when I try to write down what you mean to me. You came into my life like a quiet breeze, and before I knew it, you became my entire atmosphere. Every laugh we share, every late-night call where we lose track of time, and even the moments when distance makes things hard, only serves to show me how special what we have is. <br/><br/>
                      You have a way of lighting up my darkest days with just a single text. I love your innocence, your gentle soul, and the fierce loyalty you carry. I want to promise you that no matter what storms come, I am holding your hand. I believe in you, in your dreams, and in us. Thank you for choosing me every single day. Always yours, my love. ❤️
